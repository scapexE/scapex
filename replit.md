# Scapex — Smart Business Management Platform (ERP)

## User Preferences
- **Communication**: Always respond in Arabic. After finishing ANY task, always give the user a clear summary of all actions taken (what changed, where, and whether it was deployed).
- **Design Philosophy**: Build every feature as an advanced version of Odoo + SAP — professional, data-rich, contextual. Centralized data, multiple access points, no duplication.
- **Document Storage**: All file content stored in PostgreSQL as base64 (TEXT column `file_content`). Max 15MB per file. Documents shared by `contact_id` (company-level) or `deal_id` (deal-specific).
- **CRM Documents**: Use the unified `documents` table with `contact_id`/`deal_id` columns — accessible from both CRM Drawer and DMS module. No separate document store.

## Architecture
- **Version**: Auto-incremented via `version.json` — patch number bumps on every `npm run build` (deploy). Injected into frontend via Vite `define` as `__APP_VERSION__`. Displayed only in sidebar footer.
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite, wouter routing, shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express (port 5000) — serves API routes + static files
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM — 62 tables covering all modules
- **DB Connection**: `server/db.ts` — pooled connection via `DATABASE_URL`
- **Schema**: `shared/schema.ts` — comprehensive schema with multi-tenant support (`company_id` on all tables)
- **Languages**: Full Arabic (RTL) + English (LTR) bilingual — toggled via `useLanguage()` hook
- **Data Storage**: All `scapex_*` data stored in PostgreSQL `app_data` table (key-value JSONB), synced to/from localStorage as cache via `client/src/lib/dbStorage.ts`
- **Companies & Branches**: Fully migrated to PostgreSQL via REST API (`/api/companies`, `/api/branches`). Seed data auto-populates on first boot. Company Settings syncs main company (type="main") to DB on save. Settings merge-preserved on updates.
- **Auth**: Session in localStorage (non-scapex key), RBAC + multi-activity permissions + real email verification via Resend
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark/light mode with clear card borders and distinct background/card contrast
- **Client Portal**: 6 color themes (Default, Ocean, Forest, Royal, Sunset, Slate) + dark mode toggle
- **Auth Features**: Forgot password (verification code), real email verification on registration (Resend integration), admin approval flow
- **Email Verification**: `server/email.ts` — Resend connector sends 6-digit code on registration; server-side enforcement (register blocked without verified email); rate limiting (60s cooldown), max 5 attempts, 10-min expiry, 15-min verified window

## Key Storage Keys (localStorage — frontend data, pending migration to PostgreSQL API)
- `scapex_proposals` — proposals cache (DB is source of truth via /api/proposals; hydrated on load, write-through on save)
- `scapex_contracts` — contracts cache (DB is source of truth via /api/contracts; hydrated on load, write-through on save)

- `users` — user accounts (version: v3)

- `scapex_system_settings::<companyId>` — PER-COMPANY system settings + print templates. Written when saving a specific company's settings in the Company Management → "Company Info & Settings" tab. `getSystemSettings(companyId?)` falls back to the global key when no per-company record exists; saving the main company also mirrors to the global key (`alsoGlobal`).
